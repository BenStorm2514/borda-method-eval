## Repo Overview
This repo contains the python script used to evaluate various Borda methods across more than 400 elections.
Ballots were provided by Otis D. at [https://dataverse.harvard.edu](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/AMK8PJ).

## Preference Profile Generation
Preference profiles were generated by taking each election ballot (See [Example Election Ballot](Example_Election_Ballot.csv)) and ordering the candidates while removing duplicates and write-in wherever possible. Then each permutation of candidates existing in the ballots were counted up to produce our Preference Profiles (See [Example_Preference_Profile](Example_Preference_Profile.csv)). The script used to convert ballots to preference profiles can be found here: [PreferenceProfileConverter](Python_Scripts/PreferenceProfileConverter.ipynb). Small tweak may have been make on a ballot by ballot basis to ensure that all of the ballots were regularized.

## Initial Winners
To determine the winner of each election we developed and algorithm that would determine the winner with normal Borda and Borda variants (See [BordaWithEquity](Python_Scripts/BordaWithEquity.ipynb)).
